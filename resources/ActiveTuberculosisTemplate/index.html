    <p>Patients with a history of active tuberculosis or latent tuberculosis who were treated do not need regular skin/quantiferon testing.</p>
    <p>Healthcare workers should undergo a screening questionnaire. Routine chest x-ray to evaluate for active TB is not recommended by the CDC. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/topic/testing/healthcareworkers.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/tb/topic/testing/healthcareworkers.htm</a></p>
