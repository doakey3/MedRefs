PROCEDURE (No Phenol)
A timeout was completed before the start of the procedure. The area was cleaned with [CHLORHEXIDINE/POVIDONE] and draped in a sterile fashion. The toe was anesthetized with a total of [CC's] mL lidocaine 1% without epinephrine. An elastic tourniquet was applied at the base of the toe to minimize bleeding. A nail elevator was used to separate nail from bed. Nail scissors were used to separate the [LATERAL/MEDIAL] [MILLIMETERS] mm of the nail, which was then removed with clamps. The area was treated with bacitracin, covered in sterile gauze, and wrapped with Coban.

A nail elevator was used to separate nail from bed. Nail scissors were used to separate the [LATERAL/MEDIAL] [MILLIMETERS] mm of the nail, which was then removed with clamps. After achieving good hemostasis, the nail germinal matrix was chemically cauterized with phenol for 3 minutes. 70% isopropyl alcohol was dripped on the nail groove to neutralize the phenol. The area was treated with bacitracin, covered in sterile gauze, and wrapped with Coban.
